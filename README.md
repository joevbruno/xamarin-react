# React Xamarin Prototyping

To begin compilation and transpilation, run:

1. `npm install` if you have not previously
2. `npm run server` fires up the node server
3. in a new tab, run 'npm start' to begin webpack watching.

Note: running `npm run prod` will generate minified files for production.

Webpack should be re-compiling on save and the node server will serve the file built by webpack from the `dist` folder
